<h2>Project Page - PC Polishing</h2>

<p id="desc">
Posterior Capsule (PC) polishing is a specific and delicate procedure that has demonstrated value towards improving surgical outcomes of lens extraction, yet is not commonly performed by surgeons due to the risk of PC rupture.
A potential way to avoid such complication and increase surgical safety is automating this procedure with a precise robotic system that accurately tracks a polishing trajectory generated from the anatomy captured by an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) system.
The robotic system is integrated with the OCT system that is capable of providing visual feedback to the robot.
The developed system was evaluated through a set of experimental trials on ex-vivo pig eyes and shown to be capable of performing automated PC polishing with no surgical complications.
The developed technology is expected to lead to improvements in cataract procedures or other techniques which are difficult or infeasible to perform with traditional methods.

	<h4>Partially Automated Lens Extraction in Ex Vivo Pig Eyes</h4>
	<p>With the development of laser-assisted platforms, the outcomes of cataract
surgery have been improved by automating several procedures. The cataract-extraction
step continues to be manually performed, but due to deficiencies in sensing capabilities,
surgical complications such as posterior capsule rupture and incomplete cataract removal remain.
An optical coherence tomography (OCT) system was integrated into the intraocular
robotic interventional surgical system (IRISS) robot.
The OCT data was used for preoperative planning and intraoperative intervention in a series of automated procedures.
Real-time intervention allowed the surgeon to evaluate the progress and override the operation.
The developed system was validated by performing lens extraction on 30 <em>ex vivo</em> pig eyes.
Complete lens extraction was achieved on 25 eyes, and ‘‘almost complete’’ extraction
was achieved on the remainder due to an inability to image small lens particles behind the iris.
No capsule rupture was found.</p>
