	<h4>Fully Automated OCT-Guided Retinal Vein Cannulation</h4>
	<p>Retinal vein occlusion is one of the most common
causes of vision loss, occurring when a blood clot or other
obstruction occludes a retinal vein. A potential remedy for retinal
vein occlusion is retinal vein cannulation, a surgical procedure
that involves infusing the vein with an antifibrinolytic to restore
blood flow through the vascular lumen. This work presents
an image-guided robotic system capable of performing fully
automated retinal vein cannulation on silicone phantoms. The
system is integrated with an optical coherence tomography probe
and camera to provide visual feedback to guide the robotic
system. Through automation, the developed system reduces the
challenges of manually performed vein access and infusion and
overcomes the inherent physiological limitations of a human
surgeon. The system was evaluated through a set of experimental
trials and shown to be capable of performing automated retinal
vein cannulation with no surgical complications. The developed
technology is expected to lead to improvements in vitreoretinal
surgical procedures such as subretinal injection or other tech-
niques which are difficult or infeasible to perform with traditional
methods.</p>

	<h4>Partially Automated Lens Extraction in Ex Vivo Pig Eyes</h4>
	<p>With the development of laser-assisted platforms, the outcomes of cataract
surgery have been improved by automating several procedures. The cataract-extraction
step continues to be manually performed, but due to deficiencies in sensing capabilities,
surgical complications such as posterior capsule rupture and incomplete cataract removal remain.
An optical coherence tomography (OCT) system was integrated into the intraocular
robotic interventional surgical system (IRISS) robot. 
The OCT data was used for preoperative planning and intraoperative intervention in a series of automated procedures. 
Real-time intervention allowed the surgeon to evaluate the progress and override the operation.
The developed system was validated by performing lens extraction on 30 <em>ex vivo</em> pig eyes. 
Complete lens extraction was achieved on 25 eyes, and ‘‘almost complete’’ extraction
was achieved on the remainder due to an inability to image small lens particles behind the iris.
No capsule rupture was found.</p>

	<h4>Quadrotor with Twisting and Tilting Rotors for Omnidirectional Thrust Vectoring</h4>
	<p>In this project, I introduced a flying vehicle that overcomes the inherent maneuverability limitations of traditional multirotors. Full directional authority is enabled on each individual thrust vector by introducing two additional degrees of freedom (twist and tilt) to each rotor. The resulting system possesses omnidirectional thrust-vectoring capabilities, fully decouples the position and attitude dynamics, and minimizes wasted thrust over its entire configuration space. The device is capable of achieving any arbitrary body orientation, thereby allowing the device to angle itself with respect to a work surface for the purpose of physical interaction. Potential applications include performing tooling operations in out-of-reach places such as cellphone towers, skyscrapers, wind turbines, elevator shafts, and the fuselages of aircraft bodies during construction.</p>
